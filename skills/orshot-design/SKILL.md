description: Design trendy, professional, on-brand Orshot studio templates. Use when creating or refining a template design via the Orshot MCP — social posts, ads, stories, carousels, banners, thumbnails. Applies the craft rules (clear hierarchy, 2-font typography, 60-30-10 color), consults the brand kit first, varies layouts so designs never repeat by type, and runs a render-and-critique loop. Pairs with the orshot MCP create/update/patch tools.

# Orshot Design — the craft layer

Make Orshot studio templates that look trendy and professionally designed, not the
generic centered-text "AI" look. This skill is the knowledge layer on top of the Orshot
MCP server's design tools (`orshot_create_template_design`, `orshot_update_template_design`,
`orshot_patch_template_elements`, `orshot_get_brand_kit`).

## When to use
Use whenever you are designing or refining a visual template: a social post/story/carousel,
an ad creative, a banner, a thumbnail, a launch graphic. For the studio element schema and
render gotchas, also consult the MCP resource `orshot://template-design-spec`.

## Boundaries
- This is design guidance — it does NOT replace the schema spec. Style values are always
  strings with units; `position`/`dimensions` are nested objects. See Compatibility below.
- It composes with the `orshot` skill (API/generation mechanics) — use that to render.

## Operating principle
**Design serves the task.** Decide the ONE thing the viewer must take away, then make
everything support it. Respect the brand and the platform over generic prettiness. Prefer
the deterministic rules below over subjective iteration.

## Required workflow (in order)
1. **Shape** — restate the goal, audience, and the single key message before placing anything.
2. **Inherit the brand (when on-brand)** — IF the design should match the user's
   brand/product (the prompt implies it, or asks for "our" style), call `orshot_get_brand_kit`
   (tag-filter to the purpose) and map brand colors/fonts/logo onto the roles in Systems. If
   the prompt asks for a generic/standalone look, use the pack defaults — don't force brand in.
3. **Pick the vertical pack** — read the matching file in `references/` (e.g.
   `references/social-media.md`) for format, safe areas, archetypes, and a concrete recipe.
   Choose a DIFFERENT archetype from recent templates of this type.
4. **Build** — establish one focal element, then support it. Keep the design simple on the
   first create; refine in a follow-up update.
5. **Critique** — create/update with `includeThumbnails:true`, READ the thumbnail, and fix
   issues with `orshot_update_template_design` / `orshot_patch_template_elements`. Never ship
   the first pass unseen. (The create tool also returns a "🎨 Design check" — resolve its ⚠s.)

## Systems
- **Hierarchy** — one clear focal point via size, weight, and position. Not everything centered.
- **Typography** — exactly **2 font families** (display + body). Hierarchy from scale/weight.
  Tight `lineHeight` (1.0–1.15) and slightly negative `letterSpacing` on large display type.
  Heaviest brand font → display, lighter → body.
- **Color — 60-30-10** — 60% dominant, 30% secondary, 10% accent. Cohesive palette beats more
  colors. Clear WCAG AA contrast. Map brand colors to roles by USAGE, not by "primary" label.
- **Composition & space** — generous margins (≥ ~6% of canvas per edge), align to an implied
  grid, prefer off-center over dead-center stacking.
- **Imagery** — full-bleed or intentionally framed; `objectFit:"cover"` for photos; add a
  gradient scrim under text over busy photos.

## Brand (contextual — not mandatory)
Use the brand kit WHEN the design should be on-brand (the prompt references the user's brand,
product, or identity): colors → 60-30-10 roles, fonts → display/body, logo → a small
corner/footer mark, images → hero/product. For a generic/exploratory/standalone look, the
pack palette is fine — don't force brand assets in.

## Variety
**Never repeat a layout for the same content type.** Vary archetype, focal placement, and
color emphasis between designs of the same kind.

## Compatibility (get these right or the render silently breaks)
- ALL style values are **strings with units**: `"48px"`, `"700"`, `"12px"` — never bare numbers.
- `position` and `dimensions` are **nested objects** (`{x,y}`, `{width,height}`).
- **Set `textMode:"fit"` + `minFontSize` on EVERY text element** (floors: headline 48,
  subtitle 28, body 24, kicker 18, caption 14). The default `"overflow"` does not shrink or
  reflow — long/parameterized text spills out of its box.
- Line breaks: use `\n`, **NEVER `<br>`**; avoid multiple `<p>` blocks (they overlap). For a
  multi-line headline with one accent-colored word, use one text element per line.
- A **background-highlight `<span>` (colored pill) forces the whole element to one line**
  (`white-space: nowrap`) → overflow on long text. Highlight only 1–3 words; for long
  headlines use `color` emphasis (no background) or split per line.
- Parameterizable fields need `parameterizable:true`, a unique snake_case `parameterId`, and a
  `parameterType` matching the element (text→"text", image→"imageUrl", shape→"fill",
  canvas/container→"backgroundColor").
- Shapes with transparent fill + a border render nothing; SVG `content` must be a data-URI.

## Anti-patterns (the AI-slop tells — avoid)
- Everything centered and stacked; no focal point.
- 3+ fonts, or random sizes with no hierarchy.
- Low-contrast text on a busy photo with no scrim.
- Forcing brand assets when the prompt didn't ask for an on-brand design (or ignoring the kit when it clearly did).
- A tiny headline above a paragraph of body copy (a template is not a document).
- Re-emitting the previous layout for the same content type.

## Vertical packs (progressive disclosure)
Read the one matching the task — each adds format/safe-areas, archetypes, and a recipe:
- `references/social-media.md` — posts, stories, carousels.
- (more verticals — ads, real-estate, e-commerce — added here over time.)

## Examples

### Example 1 — "Make an Instagram post announcing our new feature"
1. `orshot_get_brand_kit` (tags: "social-media") → brand colors/fonts/logo.
2. Read `references/social-media.md` → default 4:5 portrait 1080×1350; pick the `type-hero`
   archetype (different from the last post).
3. `orshot_create_template_design` with brand display font for an oversized headline, brand
   dominant color as background, accent color on one word, logo + @handle footer,
   `includeThumbnails:true`.
4. Read the thumbnail + "🎨 Design check"; patch contrast/spacing as needed.

### Example 2 — "Refine this template, it looks generic"
1. `orshot_get_studio_template` to inspect the current design.
2. Diagnose against Anti-patterns (centered? 3+ fonts? no focal point? brand ignored?).
3. `orshot_patch_template_elements` to set one focal headline, trim to 2 fonts, apply brand
   60-30-10, left/bottom-align. Re-render with `includeThumbnails:true` and verify.

## Troubleshooting

**Headline shows on one line / `<br>` ignored.** Use `\n`, not `<br>`. For a colored word on
a multi-line headline, split into one text element per line.

**Colors/fonts look off-brand.** You skipped step 2 — call `orshot_get_brand_kit` and map the
returned `value` (colors) and `name` (fonts) onto the design.

**"🎨 Design check" warns about repetition.** This layout matches a recent same-type template.
Switch archetype and move the focal point.
